# Databases

Repository for the Database systems I've developed.

PLEASE NOTE!
The Coronavirus database was compiled on SQLite 3. I have not tested it on Access or MySQL.
If you've got any questions, please email them at: miro2milanov@gmail.com

In order to create the proper DB, run dataset.sql then dataset2.sql then dataset3.sql in this order.
